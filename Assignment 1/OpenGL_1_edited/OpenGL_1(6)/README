This is a README file

When submitting your assignment, describe (briefly) the changes you made and what difficulties you encountered in this file.

We mostly sruggled with finding the right functions.

Also describe what controls (key short-cuts, mouse clicks, mouse movement etc) and possible bonus assignments you implemented, so we can check them more easily.

If you have any suggestions/feedback for improving the practical assignments or support from teaching assistants, you may include it here OR post in anonymously on Nestor under Feedback.

We would like more help with the functions build in qt and how to implement them.
